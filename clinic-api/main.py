"""Clinic data service -- implements the exact 3-endpoint contract
agent/tools_client.py in the voice agent already expects. Backed by
PostgreSQL, seeded with dummy departments/doctors/schedules/tests via
seed.py.

Entity matching lives in match_band.py, which scores every spelling the
catalogue holds and returns one of three verdicts -- commit, ambiguous,
none. It is still simple (difflib plus a containment tier) rather than the
phonetic-fold gazetteer that production callers slurring "লিপিড প্রোফাইল"
through a phone mic deserve. What changed is that it no longer resolves an
ambiguity by picking a row: several plausible rows come back as several, and
the agent asks. The single-test lookups below (search, preparation, sample,
duration, walk-in eligibility, prescription requirements) share a simpler
exact/Bengali-alias-then-fuzzy ladder (_find_lab_test() /
_lab_test_fuzzy_suggestions()) -- see search_test()'s own docstring for why
that endpoint alone goes through match_band instead.

======================================================================
UPDATED BY SOURAV -- "Lab Report Status & Secure Delivery" combined
story (previously two separate stories: "is my report ready" and "send
my report"), per the VOICE CARE AGENT FINAL TESTING / STORY / RULES /
EDGE-CASE ATTACK PLAN doc.

Added below (search "SOURAV" for every changed/new block):
  - GET  /api/v1/reports/status           (Rule 1-3, 13, 14; Section 4)
  - POST /api/v1/reports/delivery/request (Rule 3, 4, 15, 16)
  - POST /api/v1/reports/otp/verify       (Rule 4-9, 17; the whole OTP
                                            attack surface in Section 6)
  - GET  /api/v1/reports/link/{token}     (Rule 11, 12; Section 8 link
                                            attacks)

FAIL SAFE, NOT FAIL OPEN (plan Section 23) is the guiding principle for
every one of these: every endpoint below returns a NAMED reason instead
of a generic error/boolean whenever it refuses to act, precisely so the
voice agent (main.py / main_pcm.py) never has to guess why something
didn't happen, and never defaults to acting just because a check was
inconclusive.

# audio to calibrate against yet, unlike voicerx/gate.py's SIMILARITY_FLOOR).
#
# This exists because of a bug caught in local testing: matching the raw
# query against the full formatted name ("Dr. A. Sen") let a query for
# "Doctor Nobody" fuzzy-match "Dr. N. Roy" at ratio 0.522 -- HIGHER than the
# ratio for a real garbled name against its own doctor ("sen" vs "Dr. A. Sen"
# scores only 0.462, because SequenceMatcher penalizes the length mismatch
# against the "Dr. X." prefix on both sides, so short queries and wrong
# queries land in the same range). That is this system's own small version
# of the "Naloxone" bug: confidently answering with the wrong doctor's real
# schedule instead of saying "not found".
#
# Fix: match against the SURNAME only, which cleanly separates the two
# cases in testing -- genuine garbles (e.g. "mukharji" vs "Mukherjee")
# scored 0.70-0.80; unrelated queries (e.g. "doctor nobody" vs "Roy")
# scored <=0.44. 0.60 sits in the gap. Recalibrate once real call audio
# exists, the same way gate.py's floors were tightened from real samples.

# The surname is passed as an extra form because it is what callers actually
# say -- "Sen", not "Dr. A. Sen" -- and because it is the form that makes the
# tiering matter: "সেন" EQUALS Dr Sen's alias (1.0) and is CONTAINED IN Dr
# Sengupta's (0.90), so it clears the margin and commits, where a flat
# containment score for both would have asked the caller to choose between a

    """ADDED BY SOURAV -- "Caller asks when a doctor sits" story.

    Deliberately DATE-FREE, unlike doctor_availability() just above. That
    endpoint always resolves to one particular day (today, an explicit
    date, or the computed "next available" day) because it answers "is
    the doctor in THEN". This endpoint answers a different, more general
    question a caller actually asks in practice -- "which days does Dr X
    usually sit?" -- with no date involved at all: it returns the
    doctor's FULL recurring weekly schedule, every DoctorSchedule row
    they have, in weekday order (0=Monday .. 6=Sunday, matching
    DoctorSchedule's own docstring). The caller-facing wording is built
    from this list in agent/reply_templates.py::doctor_schedule_reply().

    FIXED BY SOURAV -- KCD-385. This endpoint used to call a function
    named `_find_doctor`, which does not exist anywhere in this file (it
    was the pre-refactor name -- every other doctor lookup below was
    updated to call `_resolve_doctor()` instead, see that function's own
    docstring, but this one endpoint was missed). Every call here raised
    a NameError, for every query, found or not. Now resolved the same
    way doctor_availability() and book_appointment() already do, which
    also means an unknown/misspelled name now goes through the same
    near-match ranker they use instead of a flat not-found (see the
    AMBIGUOUS branch below, and match_band.py's own module docstring for
    the "Doctor Nobody" incident this ranker exists to fix).

    Response shapes:
      found=false: {"found": false, "query": "..."}
      found=false, ambiguous: {"found": false, "ambiguous": true,
        "query": "...", "candidates": [{"name", "name_bn"}, ...]} -- see
        _ambiguous_reply()'s own docstring for why this is its own shape
        rather than an overloaded found=false.
      found=true, doctor is currently on leave (ADDED BY SOURAV --
        KCD-385 AC: "A doctor who is on leave is reported as such with

        "leave_return_date": "YYYY-MM-DD" or null, "schedule": []} --
        checked and returned BEFORE the DoctorSchedule rows are read at
        all. Deliberately not read as "schedule": [] plus the caller
        having to infer why: a doctor's normal recurring rows are left
        untouched in the database while they are on leave (they resume
        the same days on return), so without this explicit flag a caller
        would be told the same "no fixed schedule" sentence a genuinely
        schedule-less doctor gets, which is not what is actually true
        here and gives no return date even when one is known.
      found=true, doctor not on leave, has 1+ scheduled weekdays:
        {"found": true, "doctor_name": "...", "doctor_name_bn": "...",
         "on_leave": false,
         "schedule": [{"weekday": 0, "start_time": "10:00", "end_time": "12:00"}, ...]}
      found=true, doctor not on leave but has ZERO DoctorSchedule rows (a
      real, honest edge case -- a doctor between assignments with no
      chamber days configured at all, distinct from being on leave):
      "on_leave": false, "schedule": [] -- the caller-facing reply

# and agent/callback_flow.py's module docstring for why "operating hours"
# is checked entirely on the VOICE AGENT side (main.py), before this
# endpoint is ever called -- this endpoint's only job is to persist a
# request that has already been decided to be acceptable; it does not
# re-check availability itself, the same division of labour
# book_appointment() above already has with the agent's own slot
# collection (the agent decides WHEN to call this; this endpoint decides
# only HOW to store what it's given).
