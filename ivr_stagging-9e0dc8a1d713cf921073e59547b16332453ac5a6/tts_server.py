"""AI4Bharat Bengali TTS -- FastAPI wrapper around coqui-tts's Synthesizer.

Matches the contract agent/tts.py's TTSClient expects: POST /synthesize
with {"text": ..., "lang": "bn"} -> raw WAV bytes.

The Synthesizer is loaded ONCE at module import (not per-request) --
model load takes several seconds and holds real GPU memory, so this must
be a long-lived process, not spawned per call.

WHY THIS DOES MORE THAN CALL synthesizer.tts()
----------------------------------------------
A single FastPitch pass over a whole multi-clause reply is what makes this
voice sound like a machine, and it is fixable without changing models:

* No breaths. FastPitch renders one flat prosodic contour across an entire
  utterance. Real speakers stop between clauses. Splitting on Bengali
  sentence and clause boundaries and inserting real silence is the single
  largest naturalness gain available here.
* Ragged padding. Each pass emits its own leading/trailing near-silence of
  arbitrary length, so naive concatenation produces gaps that are too long
  in some places and absent in others. Each chunk is trimmed, then padded
  by an amount chosen for the punctuation that ended it.
* Rushed delivery. length_scale 1.0 is noticeably fast for a service line
  a caller is trying to write a price down from. Slightly above 1 reads as
  measured rather than sluggish.
* Inconsistent level. Peak varies per utterance, which on a phone sounds
  like the speaker keeps moving. Normalizing to a fixed peak fixes it.

Every one of these is tunable per-request (see SynthesizeRequest) so the
settings can be A/B'd against a real handset without a redeploy.

# retry firing a second request while the first is still running after a
# client-side timeout -- would otherwise run two `.tts()` passes on the
# SAME Synthesizer/CUDA context at once, and both mutate its shared
# `length_scale` attribute right before calling it (see _render() below).
# That is a real mechanism for exactly "voice sometimes jamming/cracking
# in long conversations": longer calls mean more requests and more chances
# for the GPU to be briefly busy enough to trigger a client retry while the
# original synthesis is still in flight, so the corrupt-concurrent-call
# case gets MORE likely as a conversation runs longer, not less. A single
# lock around inference serializes those calls -- request queueing costs a
# little latency under real overlap, which is strictly better than
# occasionally handing back garbled or partially-overwritten audio.

    person says "Hello," with a small breath before continuing, and a
    single flat pass with no internal pause reads as one run-on machine
    sentence, no matter how the length_scale is tuned. Every reply
