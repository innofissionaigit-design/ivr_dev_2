"""REST client for the clinic's Java (Spring Boot) + PostgreSQL service.

This service owns the actual facts -- prices, schedules, slot availability
-- and is the only thing allowed to state them. The contract below is what
that service needs to implement; nothing here assumes it exists yet.

Every method returns a plain dict and NEVER raises for a normal "not
found" / "unavailable" outcome -- those are valid, expected answers a
caller can be told. It only raises ToolCallError for actual infrastructure
failure (timeout, connection refused, 5xx), which main.py maps to a
distinct "I couldn't check that right now" reply instead of a false
"not found".

# story title: The model never originates a fact
# user story: As a clinical lead, I want every price, date and identifier
#   to come from a verified system response, so that a wrong answer is a
#   data bug rather than a model bug.
# acceptance criteria: Every factual sentence is a template substitution
#   from a validated tool response and the model is never shown a figure
#   it could restate. An automated assertion on every commit proves no
#   model-composed span reaches synthesis on a factual intent.
#
# The "Expected response shape" comments above each method below used to be
# the ONLY statement of the contract. They are now checked: every response is
# validated at this boundary before any template is allowed to read a fact out
# of it. A violation is re-raised as ToolCallError so main.py's existing
# failure path handles it unchanged -- but the log line says "contract", not
# "connection", so a clinic-api schema regression stops looking like an outage.

# story title: A thing not existing is never confused with a system being down
# user story: As a caller, I want to know whether my test does not exist or the
#   system cannot be reached, so that I know whether to call back.
# acceptance criteria: The two produce different spoken sentences and different
#   metrics, and the distinction survives every refactor. This behaviour exists
#   today and gains a permanent regression case.
#
# THE CHOKE POINT. Every clinic call returns through this module and every
# failure is raised from it, so this is the one place that can tell "the thing
# does not exist" from "the clinic did not answer" without anyone remembering
# to say so. See agent/tool_outcome.py for why not main.py.
from agent import tool_outcome

# story title: Numbers are never rounded, reordered or approximated
# user story: As a patient, I want the exact figure, so that what I am quoted
#   is what I pay.
# acceptance criteria: Figures pass from the validated response into the
#   template unchanged and are verbalised digit-faithfully. A test asserts
#   byte-level equality between the tool value and the spoken value for a
#   corpus of amounts, dates and identifiers.
#
# Ported from dev_sourav. The whole fix is the parse_float argument, and it
# earns its place: httpx's r.json() uses json.loads' default float parsing, and
# float("100.00") == float("100.0") -- so a trailing zero is gone before any
# template, any verbaliser or any speech stage could possibly preserve it. No
# amount of care downstream can put a digit back that was discarded at the
# boundary. Money is precisely the kind of figure this loses digits on, on
# every value whose decimals happen to end in zero, silently, every time.
#
# Whole numbers are untouched: no decimal point in the source means no float in
# the first place, so 650 stays int 650 exactly as before.
#
# It also composes with this module's own failure handling rather than fighting
# it -- json.loads raises JSONDecodeError, which subclasses ValueError, so a
# malformed body still lands in the ValueError arm each method already has and
# is still reported as "the system cannot be reached".
#
# HONEST STATUS ON THIS BRANCH: dormant. clinic-api/models.py declares
# rate_inr as Column(Integer), so the live schema cannot emit a decimal rate
# today and nothing in production exercises this path. Correct and defensive,
# and it costs one keyword argument, so it goes in now rather than being
# remembered later when a rate first gains paise.

    rate goes through the ordinary `float`, its trailing zero is gone for
    good -- "100.00" becomes "100.0" and stays that way through every
