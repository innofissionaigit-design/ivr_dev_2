"""What a clinic-api response must contain before a template may read it.

# story title: The model never originates a fact
# user story: As a clinical lead, I want every price, date and identifier
#   to come from a verified system response, so that a wrong answer is a
#   data bug rather than a model bug.
# acceptance criteria: Every factual sentence is a template substitution
#   from a validated tool response and the model is never shown a figure
#   it could restate. An automated assertion on every commit proves no
#   model-composed span reaches synthesis on a factual intent.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The criterion says every factual sentence is a substitution from a VALIDATED
tool response. Nothing was validating anything. agent/tools_client.py returned
r.json() verbatim and the expected shape was written down as a COMMENT above
each method -- accurate, and enforced by nobody.

What happened instead was that reply_templates.py did the checking by accident:

    rate = result["rate_inr"]                    # test_rate_reply
    result['confirmation_id']                    # booking_reply

A response with found=true and no rate_inr raised KeyError inside the template,
which main.py's broad `except` turned into "এই মুহূর্তে দেখতে পারছি না".

That fails SAFE, which is why nobody noticed, and it is worth being precise
about what was wrong with it. Three things:

  * The failure was reported as a tool-call failure, so a clinic-api schema
    regression would have looked exactly like the API being down.
  * It only covers the fields a template happens to subscript with [] rather
    than .get(). `sample_type`, `chamber_hours` and `available` are all read
    with .get() and would silently render as "absent" instead of "wrong".
  * A guard that lives in whichever template happens to be executing is not a
    contract. It cannot be pointed at, and it changes whenever someone edits a
    sentence.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
---------------------
It does not validate TYPES or VALUES -- it will not catch a rate of -5 or a
date of "yesterday". Required keys, checked once, at the boundary. That is the
line between "the response has the shape we agreed on" and "the clinic's data
is correct", and the second one is the clinic's job, not the agent's. Widening
this into a schema library would be more dependency than rule.

Keys are checked for PRESENCE, not truthiness. `chamber_hours: null` is a
correct answer to "is the doctor in on Tuesday" and must not be an error.
