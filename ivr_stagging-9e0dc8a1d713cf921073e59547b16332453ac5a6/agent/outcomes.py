"""The insufficient-verified-information outcome.

Story: "The agent says it cannot confirm rather than guessing" (Epic:
Answer Quality and Grounding; near-duplicate acceptance criteria also sit
under the Truth Validator epic's "The insufficient-verified-information
outcome as a first-class path" -- same owner, not yet picked up, flagged
rather than silently merged).

This is a THIRD outcome, distinct from the two that already exist in this
codebase:

  * "not-found"              -- the tool answered cleanly and the answer
                                 is "no" (agent/reply_templates.py's
                                 found=False / success=False branches).
  * "infrastructure apology" -- the tool call itself failed
                                 (agent/tools_client.py's ToolCallError,
                                 caught in four places in main_pcm.py,
                                 all four speaking the same hardcoded
                                 "can't check this right now" line).
  * "insufficient-verified-information" (this file) -- the tool call
    SUCCEEDED and returned a value, but the value cannot be trusted
    enough to speak. The agent says so plainly instead of guessing.

SCOPE -- deliberately narrow, per the three constraints agreed before this
was built:

  1. REAL TRIGGER, and only this one: main_pcm.py's _finish_booking()
     calls missing_booking_write_fields() after book_appointment() reports
     success, and checks only that confirmation_id, date and time_slot
     came back non-empty before any of them is read aloud. That is the
     bare minimum any caller of a write API should do, and it is
     deliberately NOT:
       - shape/type validation of the response       ("Schema drift
         rejected at the boundary" -- a different, unpicked story; that
         story's own acceptance criteria route a malformed response to
         the INFRASTRUCTURE APOLOGY, not to this outcome)
       - a plausibility/business-rule check on the values ("Business rule
         validation before verbalisation" -- different, unpicked story)
       - a freshness/staleness check                 ("Freshness bounds
         per field with withholding" -- different, unpicked story)
       - a re-verification of who is allowed to hear the value
         ("Authorisation re-verified at the validator" -- different,
         unpicked story)
       - a re-query of the database to confirm the row really persisted
         ("Write confirmation validated before it is spoken" -- different,
         unpicked story)
       - a fix for the doctor-name fuzzy-matcher silently picking its best
         guess with no confirmation ("Near matches are offered rather than
         guessed or refused" -- different, unpicked story; that one is
         about OFFERING candidates, a different UX from this outcome)
     Building any of those is the rest of the "Truth Validator" epic, not
     this story.

  2. NO FAKE RATE. The acceptance criterion says "its rate is reported per
     intent". A rate needs a denominator -- attempts per intent -- and
     nothing in this codebase counts attempts per intent today (there is
     no metrics system here at all; see below). This file tracks the
     COUNT per intent only, via insufficient_verified_information_counts().
     Dividing by a future attempts-counter, wherever that ends up living,
     is a one-line change against this function -- it is not something
     this file fabricates a denominator for now.

  3. ESCALATION PATH is the JSONL ledger this file appends to
     (ESCALATION_LOG_PATH). This codebase has no metrics or audit
     infrastructure of any kind today -- every existing signal is a plain
     `logging.getLogger("main")` call with no aggregation. A JSONL ledger
     is the smallest thing that is still durable, greppable by a human,
     and diffable, without inventing a dependency this repo doesn't have.
     Wiring it to a real paging/alerting system (PagerDuty, a Slack
     webhook, whatever the clinic actually uses) is a deployment
     integration decision that this file cannot honestly make up against
     a backend that has none today -- record_insufficient_verified_
     information() is exactly the function such an integration would call
     into.
