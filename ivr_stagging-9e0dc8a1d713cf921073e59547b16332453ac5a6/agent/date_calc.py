"""The deterministic date calculator. Code owns the calendar; the model does not.

story title: The model never originates a fact
user story: As a clinical lead, I want every price, date and identifier to come
    from a verified system response, so that a wrong answer is a data bug rather
    than a model bug.
acceptance criteria: Every factual sentence is a template substitution from a
    validated tool response and the model is never shown a figure it could
    restate. An automated assertion on every commit proves no model-composed
    span reaches synthesis on a factual intent.

THE DIVISION OF AUTHORITY
-------------------------
    LLM              understand that "আগামী সপ্তাহে" means NEXT WEEK
    this module      turn NEXT WEEK into 2026-09-14 .. 2026-09-20
    caller           confirm, when the interpretation covers more than one day
    clinic-api       establish what is actually true on those dates
    templates        say the result

The model may name the meaning. It may not name the dates. Those are two
different jobs and they were previously done by the same component: llm.py's
prompt carried today's date and asked the model to "resolve relative Bengali
time words ... to an ISO yyyy-mm-dd", so a 7B model was doing calendar
arithmetic and the answer went straight into a tool call and out of the
agent's mouth.

WHY AN EXPRESSION VOCABULARY AND NOT A DATE
-------------------------------------------
Three things get fixed by moving the model one step back:

1. Arithmetic stops being guesswork. "আগামী শনিবার" is a lookup here and a
   plausible-token-sequence there.

2. THE CACHE STOPS GOING STALE. agent/semantic_cache.py stores the extraction
   keyed by the caller's words, with a 6-hour TTL. An ISO date cached at 20:00
   for "কাল" is served at 01:00 to a caller for whom "কাল" now means a
   different day -- a wrong date, from a correct cache, with nothing anywhere
   logging a problem. An EXPRESSION never goes stale: "tomorrow" is still
   "tomorrow" six hours later, and it is resolved fresh on every turn.

3. Today's date leaves the prompt entirely. It was the one figure the model
   was ever shown, and "the model is never shown a figure it could restate"
   becomes literally true rather than nearly true.

WHY A RANGE IS DIFFERENT FROM A DAY
-----------------------------------
"আগামীকাল" is one day: there is nothing for the caller to disambiguate and
asking would be noise. "আগামী সপ্তাহে" is seven, and the agent cannot answer
"is Dr Sen in?" about seven days at once -- so it says which seven it means
and lets the caller agree or narrow.

The confirmation sentence may safely contain the dates BECAUSE THEY WERE
COMPUTED HERE. That is the whole point of the split: a date the model invented
could not be read out, even inside a question, without asserting something
nobody verified.
