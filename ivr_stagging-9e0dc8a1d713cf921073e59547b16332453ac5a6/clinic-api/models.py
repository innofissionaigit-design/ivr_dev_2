"""
SQLAlchemy models for the clinic's dummy PostgreSQL data.

Prototype-grade on purpose: this exists so the voice agent can call
a realistic backend while being bench-tested.

All data is fictional and intended only for testing.

======================================================================
CHATGPT ADDITION NOTE
======================================================================


1. Add clinic opening and closing time.
2. Add clinic address and directions.
3. Add health packages.
4. Add patient details such as name and phone number.
5. Add patient-specific laboratory reports.
6. Support testing whether a patient's report is ready or not ready.
7. Support report-not-found cases.
8. Add OTP verification for sending reports.
9. Add report delivery tracking and audit information.
10. Add expiring signed-link information instead of permanent attachments.
11. Support English, Hinglish/Banglish and Bengali-script caller inputs.
12. Add enough structure to test edge cases for:
       - report ready
       - report not ready
       - report not found
       - wrong patient
       - wrong phone
       - wrong OTP
       - expired OTP
       - expired report link
       - failed delivery
       - successful delivery
       - repeated delivery attempts
13. Keep the existing doctor, department, schedule, laboratory and
    appointment functionality intact.

#
# Used for:

#
# Testable states:
#
#   valid OTP
#   wrong OTP
#   expired OTP
#   already-used OTP
#   too many attempts
#
# NOTE:
# In a real production system the OTP should NOT be stored in plaintext.

# CHATGPT ADDITION - CREATED BY SOURAV.

# ADDED BY SOURAV -- the user's own explicit instruction: "the otp and
# other things will not be hardcoded". This replaces two previously
# hardcoded, guessable literals:
#   - clinic-api/main.py's own FRESH_OTP_CODE constant ("135790"), minted
#     every time request_report_delivery() has no reusable OTP row to
#     hand back out.
#   - clinic-api/seed.py's OTP_DATA list, which used to give every seeded
#     ReportOTP row ("482913", "615204", "903217", "731846") a fixed
#     literal too.
# Both call sites now call THIS function instead, so there is exactly one
# place in the whole codebase that decides what an OTP code looks like.
# `secrets.randbelow` (not `random`) because this is a real, security-
# relevant credential (RULE 9: it gates report delivery) even though this
# is a prototype -- see this class's own "Production should store a hash
# instead" comment just below for the next hardening step past this one.

# fulfilment (e.g., stored in a DB table/queue with pending status)".
# `status` starts at "pending" and is expected to move to "fulfilled" or
# "cancelled" by whatever staff-facing process consumes this queue -- no
# such process exists in this prototype (there is no admin UI anywhere in
# this codebase), so this table alone is the entire scope of that AC: a
# real, persisted, greppable queue, not an in-memory list that a process
# restart would silently lose.
#
# Deliberately its OWN table, not a repurposed Appointment row: a callback
# has no doctor, no date/time_slot pair, and no patient_name -- forcing it
# into Appointment's shape would mean either fabricating those fields or
