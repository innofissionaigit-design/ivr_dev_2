"""ADDED BY SOURAV -- fixes a real production bug, reported directly from
a live call transcript:

    [User] Is my report ready?
    [AI]   Can you tell me your registered phone number?
    [User] Yes, write nine zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one.
    [AI]   Can you tell me your registered phone number?
    [User] I said the number is nine zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one.
    [AI]   Can you tell me your registered phone number?
    [User] Nine then eight zeros and one
    [AI]   Sorry, I didn't understand. Could you say it again?
    [User] You can do it by knowing the number and giving the name.
    [AI]   Can you tell me your registered phone number?
    [User] Nine eight zero one

The caller was stuck in an infinite "please give your phone number" loop
because agent/slot_parse.py's parse_phone() only ever understood LITERAL
digit characters (Bengali numerals or plain ASCII digits) -- a caller who
reads their number out as spoken English words ("nine zero zero...")
produced ZERO digits after stripping non-digit characters, no matter how
many times or how clearly they repeated themselves. See parse_phone()'s
own docstring in agent/slot_parse.py for the full root-cause writeup.

parse_phone() had NO dedicated test file at all before this fix -- a real,
pre-existing gap in a function that gates identity verification (RULE
14/15) for real callers' private report data, confirmed by grepping every
file under tests/ for "parse_phone"/"parse_otp" before writing this file:
the only other reference is an unrelated docstring mention in
tests/test_booking_readback.py's own module docstring, and neither
function is exercised directly (only indirectly, through main_pcm.py
dispatch tests) anywhere else. This file covers ONLY the specific
behaviour this fix touched -- a full test suite for the rest of
slot_parse.py's existing behaviour (parse_date, parse_time,
parse_correction_field) is a separate, larger undertaking outside this
fix's scope, same reasoning tests/test_fast_path_schedule_cue.py gave for
the equivalent gap in agent/fast_path.py.
