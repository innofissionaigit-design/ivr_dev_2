"""Lightweight local parsers for slot values that fill an appointment
booking a field at a time, driven by main.py's CallSession.pending state
machine.

WHY LOCAL PARSING, NOT ANOTHER LLM CALL
----------------------------------------
Once a caller is inside a booking flow, main.py already knows exactly
which single field it just asked for. Re-running the LLM's full
intent+multi-slot extraction on a bare reply like "আজ" or "সাড়ে দশটা" is
both slower (a 7B-model round trip per field) and unreliable: llm.py's
SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE classifies intent from cue words like "বুক" /
"অ্যাপয়েন্টমেন্ট", none of which appear in a bare "আজ" -- a caller who is
already three questions into booking is not going to repeat "আমি
অ্যাপয়েন্টমেন্ট করতে চাই" every turn just so the classifier has something
to key off. This is also the root cause of the original bug report: the
LLM sees each utterance in isolation with no memory of the conversation,
so a follow-up like "10 টায়" on its own has no doctor_name/date attached
to it and the LLM has nothing to extract them from.

So each of these functions answers one narrow question -- "does this
utterance look like a date/time/phone number, and if so, which one" --
using the same trust model as fast_path.py: return None whenever not
confident, and let main.py re-prompt (or give up and fall back to a
fresh LLM classification) rather than guess.

# ADDED BY SOURAV -- "Lab Report Status & Secure Delivery" combined story.
# main_pcm.py's new "otp_code" pending state (see _continue_pending) uses
# this instead of running the caller's reply through agent/llm.py, for
# the SAME reason every other field in this file is parsed locally (see
# this module's docstring) -- PLUS a security reason unique to this one
# field: an OTP must never be sent to the LLM or the semantic cache at
# all. The LLM call is a real network hop to Ollama with its own request
# log, and agent/semantic_cache.py persists normalized utterance text as
# its cache key -- routing a 6-digit secret through either would be
# exactly the "secret-shaped literal in a log line" DoD gate 6 warns
# about, even though the OTP itself is a deliberately hardcoded prototype
# value (see clinic-api/seed.py and main.py's FRESH_OTP_CODE). Handling
# it here, alongside parse_phone, keeps it out of both.
#
# UPDATED BY SOURAV -- moved above parse_phone() (was originally defined
# only just above parse_otp(), further down this file) because parse_phone()
# now reuses this SAME word list for a real production bug fix -- see
# parse_phone()'s own docstring immediately below for the full writeup.
# Reused as-is, not duplicated or extended: still English digit words
# only (see parse_phone()'s docstring for why Bengali/Hindi spoken digit
# words are a separate, flagged, not-yet-closed gap, symmetric with the
# same pre-existing limitation this already had for OTP entry).

    """-> a 10-digit phone number, or None if the utterance doesn't
    contain enough digits to be one.

    UPDATED BY SOURAV -- fixes a real production bug, reported directly
    from a live call transcript. A caller was asked "Is my report ready?"
    (report_status), the agent asked for their registered phone number
    (RULE 14/15 -- identity is resolved by phone, never by name), and the
    caller answered by SPEAKING THE DIGITS AS WORDS:

        "Yes, write nine zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one."

    This function used to only understand literal digit characters
    (Bengali numerals, via _BN_DIGITS, or plain ASCII digits) -- spoken
    English number words were never converted to digits at all, so
    stripping every non-digit character from "nine zero zero zero zero
    zero zero zero zero one" left an EMPTY string every single time,
    which is always < 10 digits, which always returned None. The caller
    could repeat themselves as many times and as clearly as they liked
    (confirmed in the transcript -- they tried three different phrasings)
    and would be stuck in an infinite "can you tell me your registered
    phone number?" loop forever, because nothing about repeating the same
    kind of answer could ever succeed.

    Fixed by resolving spoken English digit words into digits FIRST,
    using the exact same _DIGIT_WORDS/_DIGIT_WORD_RE word list parse_otp()
    below already uses for the identical reason -- reused, not duplicated.
    "nine zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one" now correctly
    resolves to 9000000001.

    Deliberately still returns None (fails closed) for a spoken REPETITION
    shorthand like "eight zeros" (meaning the digit 0 repeated eight
    times) -- seen in the same transcript ("Nine then eight zeros and
    one") as the caller's own retry after the first phrasing wasn't
    understood. This is NOT fixed here: telling "eight zeros" (0 repeated
    8 times) apart from the caller instead meaning the two separate
    digits "eight" then "zero" is genuinely ambiguous, and a phone number
    gates a real caller's private report data -- guessing wrong here would
    silently produce the WRONG number and risk exposing (or refusing)
    the wrong person's report, which is a worse failure than asking the
    caller to repeat themselves once more. Same fail-closed posture this
    whole module already commits to everywhere else (see the module's own
    docstring: "return None whenever not confident, and let main.py
    re-prompt... rather than guess"). Flagged in this story's test report,
    not silently absorbed.

    """-> the 6-digit OTP the caller spoke, or None.

    Deliberately returns None for anything that does not resolve to
    EXACTLY 6 digits -- Section 13 of the attack plan ("very long OTP",
    "alphabetic OTP", SQL/JSON-like input, prompt-injection text) all
    fail this on purpose. This is the SAME "fail closed on anything
    ambiguous" posture parse_phone above already takes; the difference is
    parse_phone tolerates >=10 digits (a spoken country code/trunk prefix
    is genuinely part of a valid number), while an OTP has exactly one
    valid length, so anything else is rejected rather than truncated or
    padded -- truncating "4829133333" down to its first 6 digits would
    silently accept a caller who pasted in extra noise, which is exactly
    the kind of permissiveness RULE 9/RULE 6-8's security posture rules
    out.

    Handles, in order: Bengali digits ("৪৮২৯১৩"), spoken English number
    words ("four eight two nine one three"), and any amount of
    punctuation/spacing/prefix text around the digits ("OTP is 482913",
    "my otp: 482913", "48 29 13") -- the same digit-only-extraction
    convention parse_phone above uses, with the same word-to-digit
    substitution pass first. (UPDATED BY SOURAV: parse_phone() above used
    to lack this word-to-digit step entirely -- a real production bug,
    see its own docstring -- and now shares this exact same pass, not a
    separate copy of it.)

# answer names the callback option instead of a plain yes/no, the same

# like _AFFIRMATIVE/_NEGATIVE) is deliberate here: unlike a bare yes/no,
