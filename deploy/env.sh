# hypothetical: the ollama binary and the entire Postgres installation
# have each been lost to it three times.

# is deliberately NOT set here: clinic-api/otp_messaging_config.py then
# defaults it to "" and runs with no real provider connected (every OTP
# is still generated for real -- see models.generate_otp_code() -- it
# just isn't pushed anywhere; read it from the database instead). Set
# this to your own SMS/WhatsApp/e-mail provider's endpoint to actually
# deliver OTPs -- see that file's own module docstring for exactly what

# OTP_MESSAGING_WEBHOOK_URL just above -- unlike that one, though, setting
# either of these alone does NOT connect anything yet: Phase 1's walk-in/
# prescription/insurance/billing stories read from clinic-api's own local
# database only (see clinic-api/company_config.py's own module docstring).

# to true, i.e. the feature is ON unless a deploying clinic explicitly

# deployment (agent/callback_flow.py's check_callback_availability() then
# always reports "disabled", regardless of the clinic's operating hours).
