"""Tests for story "Caller asks the price of a test" (Epic: Conversation
-- Information and Enquiry, owner: Saurav) against the REAL clinic-api
FastAPI app, backed by a REAL SQLite database, seeded with the REAL
clinic-api/seed.py data -- not hand-typed `result` dicts. Mirrors
tests/test_live_insufficient_information_demo.py's established "real
backend, real seed data, real HTTP round-trip" pattern.

Why this file exists, not just more reply_templates.py unit tests: every
existing test of the price-lookup path (test_reply_templates_fidelity.py,
test_multilingual_templates.py, test_number_fidelity*.py) fabricates the
`result` dict by hand. That never exercises clinic-api/main.py's actual
live-catalogue lookup or its difflib-based near-match fallback -- both of
which this story's AC explicitly requires ("read from the live catalogue",
"an unknown test produces the not-found path with near matches offered").
This file proves those against the real thing.

Acceptance criteria under test (verbatim from the sprint sheet):
  "The price is read from the live catalogue and spoken as a natural
  sentence with the sample type and reporting time. The figure is a
  template substitution and is never composed by the model. An unknown
  test produces the not-found path with near matches offered."
(The "with the sample type and reporting time" clause was explicitly
narrowed by instruction to price-only, "not anything else" -- see
agent/reply_templates.py::test_rate_reply's docstring and
tests/test_reply_templates_fidelity.py::TestPriceOnlyReplyNoLongerBundles
for that scope change and why it's tested there, not duplicated here.)

IMPORTANT RELATED FINDING, surfaced here rather than silently fixed:
main_pcm.py's dispatch calls every reply_templates.py function with NO
`language=` argument at all (grep confirms it), so every real turn today
renders in the default "bengali" branch regardless of what language the
caller actually spoke -- agent/bn_normalize.py's detect_language() is
imported into reply_templates.py but never called anywhere. This means
the english/hinglish/banglish branches this and prior stories built are
currently unreachable from live dispatch; only the bengali branch is
exercised by a real call today. That is a pre-existing gap spanning every
multilingual story so far, not something introduced or fixed by this
one -- flagged, not addressed, here. The tests below therefore exercise
the REAL dispatch path (bengali, matching production today) plus REAL
seeded data fed directly into the other-language branches at the
reply_templates.py layer (not through dispatch), to prove those branches
are still individually correct and ready for whenever that wiring lands.
